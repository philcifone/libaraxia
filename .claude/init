  # Libaraxia - Social Reading Library App

> hello! thank you for helping me so much with my flask application. it looks and feels beautiful. it is one of the
  nicest things I have ever made, and it is with your help i did it. Thank you for taking such care to keep it as UI/UX
  friendly and appealing and consistent.

  ## Stack
  Flask, SQLite, Jinja2 templates, vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS v3,

  ## Key Concepts
  - Users have personal libraries (books they own/read)
  - Privacy levels: public/friends-only/private
  - Friend system with requests and library sharing
  - Wishlists separate from owned books

  ## Conventions
  - Blueprint structure: admin, books, user, base
  - DB migrations in migrations/ folder
  - Utility functions in utils/
  - Main DB is library.db in root of project, not in instance/
  - Almost always use white text
  - Please refrain from arbitrary hover effects or random color choices for texts
