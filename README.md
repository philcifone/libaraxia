# üöÄ Project Overview

Libaraxia is a modern web application designed to help you catalog and manage your personal library with style and efficiency. Built with Flask and SQLite, it offers a seamless interface for organizing your book collection, tracking your reading progress, and maintaining your literary life. What started as a hobbyist project has evolved into a feature-rich library management system. While it's still growing and improving, it's already a robust solution for personal library organization.
