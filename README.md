# üìö Project Overview

Libaraxia is a modern web application designed to help you catalog and manage your personal library with style and efficiency. Built with Flask and SQLite, it offers a seamless interface for organizing your book collection, tracking your reading progress, and maintaining your literary life. What started as a hobbyist project has evolved into a feature-rich library management system. While it's still growing and improving, it's already a robust solution for personal library organization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation 

Currently, Libaraxia is in active development, not stable, and not recommended for production use. However, if you're feeling adventurous and want to help beta test these instructions should in theory work:

1. git clone the repository 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/philcifone/libaraxia
```

2. Install required packages with the requirements.txt

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. To initialize SQLite database with the provided create_database.sql file run the following command:

```shell
sqlite3 your_database.db < create_database.sql
``` 

4. Configure your environment variables:

```shell
### EXAMPLE ###

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///library.db

FLASK_APP=app:create_app

GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=get_yours_at_https://console.cloud.google.com
```

5. Run in project root with flask/gunicorn/python, whichever. python3 is easiest for development server:

```shell
python3 app.py
```

### üìÖ 2025-01-22 

#### Been awhile since I updated after starting other projects. I started to rebuild this in React but realized it would be easier to simply add tailwindcss since the backend seems to function quite well here.
 - Updated tailwindcss for:
   - search/sort/filter
   - sidebar
   - add book
   - book details
   - index
- Added google books api key to book utils and books route - unsure if working!

needs addressed:
- better mobile style on book details - centered
- api title search and display on add book, need to test! - javascript??
- search bar inside top navbar, sort/filter dropdown.
  - sort reset button instead of on change?
- untracked read status not resetting? others work, low priority

#### Finished with changing all the templates to tailwind css and fixed the  api!
- Commited and pulled from repo to prod server and works!
- Tried updating search/navbar/sidebar into something more modern but couldn't get it.
- almost forgot to add the google api key :)

### üìÖ 2025-01-23
#### Images werent being added from the title/author search selection
 - mostly fixed after excruciating debugging.
 - Author and genre info are not fetching from the json data, see console, utils, and books.py.
 - see diff between old and new add_books.js, and old scripts.js (comment: populate data, fillBookForm)??
 - need to add "selected" javascript to button once the book data is fetched and populated below
 - need to add "no-cover.png" to prod server, or just do text placement. JavaScript goes brrrrr looking for it if it isn't there.
- WOOHOO fixed the search, cover fetch, and info fetch. Updated styles, working on fonts. Cant quite get it.
