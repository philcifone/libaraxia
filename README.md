# üìö Project Overview

Libaraxia is a modern web application designed to help you catalog and manage your personal library with style and efficiency. Built with Flask and SQLite, it offers a seamless interface for organizing your book collection, tracking your reading progress, and maintaining your literary life away from the prying eyes of corporations and AI. 

What started as a hobbyist project has evolved into a feature-rich library management system. While it's still growing and improving, it's already a robust and portable solution for personal library organization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation 

Currently, Libaraxia is in active development, not stable, and not recommended for production use. However, if you're feeling adventurous and want to help me beta test; the below instructions should, in theory, work. You can now install using docker if you know your way around it!

### Docker install:

1. git clone the repository and cd into it 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/philcifone/libaraxia

cd libaraxia
```

2. Create a Google Books API Key from https://console.cloud.google.com and add it to the .env.example file (.env.example included) while you also change SECRET_KEY and then run:

```shell
mv .env.example .env

mv docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml # you shouldn't need to update this
```

3. Build

```shell
sudo docker compose build --no-cache

# -d for detached mode or keep it off to watch the console
sudo docker compose up -d 
```

4. Access via the browser at localhost:5000 (local ip can be accessed after it is accessed from local host, no idea why yet.)

If needed (i.e running headless on the same network) you can use the docker container IP

Run:

```shell
sudo docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' libaraxia-web-1
```
and copy and paste the ip address followed by :5000 in your browser.

5. Register admin account upon initial startup.


6. Use the Add Book button in the bottom right to start adding books via search or ISBN (no barcode scanner yet) and start tracking your own digital library!


### If you want to build it from the repo directly it should also be pretty easy:

1. git clone the repository and cd into it 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/philcifone/libaraxia

cd libaraxia
```

2. Install required packages with the requirements.txt

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. To initialize SQLite database with the provided create_database.sql file run the following command:

```shell
sqlite3 your_database.db < create_database.sql
``` 

4. Configure your environment variables:

```shell
### EXAMPLE ###

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///library.db

FLASK_APP=app:create_app

GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY=get_yours_at_https://console.cloud.google.com
```

5. Run in project root with flask/gunicorn/python, whichever. python3 is easiest for a development server, for a production server I use gunicorn as a systemd service in an LXC container. So this will depend on your use-case I think. Happy to help if needed.

```shell
python3 app.py
```

6. Access via the browser at localhost:5000 (local ip can be accessed after it is accessed from local host, no idea why yet.)

### üí° Contributing 

Found a bug? Have a feature idea? Contributions are welcome! While this started as a personal project, I believe in the power of community-driven development, and I am not a trained developer. This has been the product of a lot of AI collaboration, and I'd love for experienced human eyes to check this out. ***PLEASE*** feel free to: 

- Open issues for bugs or feature requests 
- Submit pull requests (I've never made it this far with github so bear with me as I learn to do more than commit/push/pull)

### üìÖ 2025-01-22 

#### Been awhile since I updated after starting other projects. I started to rebuild this in React but realized it would be easier to simply add tailwindcss since the backend seems to function quite well here.
 - Updated tailwindcss for:
   - search/sort/filter
   - sidebar
   - add book
   - book details
   - index
- Added google books api key to book utils and books route - unsure if working!

needs addressed:
- better mobile style on book details - centered
- api title search and display on add book, need to test! - javascript??
- search bar inside top navbar, sort/filter dropdown.
  - sort reset button instead of on change?
- untracked read status not resetting? others work, low priority

#### Finished with changing all the templates to tailwind css and fixed the  api!
- Commited and pulled from repo to prod server and works!
- Tried updating search/navbar/sidebar into something more modern but couldn't get it.
- almost forgot to add the google api key :)

### üìÖ 2025-01-23
#### Images werent being added from the title/author search selection
 - mostly fixed after excruciating debugging.
 - Author and genre info are not fetching from the json data, see console, utils, and books.py.
 - see diff between old and new add_books.js, and old scripts.js (comment: populate data, fillBookForm)??
 - need to add "selected" javascript to button once the book data is fetched and populated below
 - need to add "no-cover.png" to prod server, or just do text placement. JavaScript goes brrrrr looking for it if it isn't there.
- WOOHOO fixed the search, cover fetch, and info fetch. Updated styles, working on fonts. Cant quite get it.
   
### üìÖ 2025-03-26
#### Docker packaging!
- Been awhile since any meaningful updates! Happy to have docker packaging figured out.
- trying to add github workflows, might be helpful.
