# Activity Feed Liking System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete liking system has been added to the activity feed, allowing users to like different types of activities from other users. Users cannot like their own activities.

## What Was Added

### 1. Database Changes
**New Table: `activity_likes`**
- Location: `migrations/007_add_activity_likes.sql`
- Tracks which users have liked which activities
- Prevents duplicate likes via UNIQUE constraint
- Includes CASCADE delete on user and book foreign keys
- Two indexes for performance optimization

### 2. Backend Routes (blueprints/feed.py)
- `POST /feed/like_activity` - Like an activity
- `POST /feed/unlike_activity` - Remove a like
- Updated `activity_feed()` to include:
  - Like counts for each activity
  - Whether current user has liked each activity
- Both routes return JSON with success status and updated like count

### 3. Frontend UI (templates/activity_feed.html)
- Heart icon button for liking (red when liked, outline when not)
- Like count displayed next to heart
- Users see read-only like count on their own activities
- Other users can click to like/unlike
- Smooth animations and hover effects

### 4. JavaScript Functionality
- `toggleLike()` function handles AJAX requests
- Real-time UI updates without page refresh
- Error handling for edge cases
- Updates heart icon, count, and state dynamically

## How It Works

1. **For Other Users' Activities:**
   - Heart icon appears in top-right corner
   - Click to like (heart fills red)
   - Click again to unlike (heart returns to outline)
   - Like count updates in real-time

2. **For Your Own Activities:**
   - No clickable like button (can't like your own posts)
   - If others have liked it, you see the count and filled heart
   - If no likes, nothing is shown

3. **Activity Types Supported:**
   - Book additions (`book_added`)
   - Wishlist additions (`wishlist_added`)
   - Collection updates (`collection_added`)
   - Reviews and ratings (`review_added`)

## Database Structure

```sql
activity_likes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    activity_type TEXT,        -- Type of activity
    book_id INTEGER,           -- Related book
    activity_user_id INTEGER,  -- User who did the activity
    liker_user_id INTEGER,     -- User who liked it
    liked_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

## Security Features
- Users cannot like their own activities (enforced server-side)
- CSRF protection via JSON requests
- Login required for all like operations
- Duplicate likes prevented by database constraint

## Performance Considerations
- Indexes on common query patterns
- Efficient SQL queries using aggregate functions
- Single query per activity to get like data
- AJAX requests prevent full page reloads

## To Apply This Feature

1. **Run the migration:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 library.db < migrations/007_add_activity_likes.sql
   ```

2. **Restart your Flask app**

3. **Test the feature:**
   - Visit the activity feed
   - Try liking activities from other users
   - Verify you cannot like your own activities
   - Check that counts update correctly

## Files Modified
- `migrations/007_add_activity_likes.sql` (new)
- `MIGRATION_007_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (new)
- `blueprints/feed.py` (modified)
- `templates/activity_feed.html` (modified)

## Future Enhancements
Possible additions:
- Show who liked an activity (tooltip or modal)
- Activity notifications when someone likes your post
- Sort feed by most liked activities
- Like analytics/stats page
